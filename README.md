# Rhyme-Generator
# Overview

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}
This app is a concise and effective way to generate ideas and words to connect to practice freestyle rapping. Via a simple interface users can generate hundreds of different word and topic combinations to test their freestyling prowess and help them gain experience connecting tough topics. 
{Describe your purpose for creating this app.}
I chose to create this app because I have been working on my freestyle rap as a hobby and this is something I needed to improve on.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I'd like to incorporate a larger dictionary, pulling from an external source.
* I'd like to add filters for different rhyme schemes so users can work on connecting more than one word at a time.
* I'd like to add support and filtration so that words and rhymes generated are all in triplet patterns, as this is a very popular method of rapping currently.
