# Rhyme-Generator
# Overview


This app is a concise and effective way to generate ideas and words to connect to practice freestyle rapping. Via a simple interface users can generate hundreds of different word and topic combinations to test their freestyling prowess and help them gain experience connecting tough topics. 

I chose to create this app because I have been working on my freestyle rap as a hobby and this is something I needed to improve on.

# Development Environment


I used Android Studio as my IDE, and created the app using Java.

I used Java to create the program, and did not use any external libraries.

# Future Work


* I'd like to incorporate a larger dictionary, pulling from an external source.
* I'd like to add filters for different rhyme schemes so users can work on connecting more than one word at a time.
* I'd like to add support and filtration so that words and rhymes generated are all in triplet patterns, as this is a very popular method of rapping currently.
